# COMP47500 Assignment 5

The main objective of this assignment seems to be comparing Tarjan’s and Kosaraju’s algorithms for graph processing. These algorithms are widely used for various graph-related tasks, such as finding strongly connected components. This comparison likely involves assessing factors like time complexity, memory usage, and overall efficiency to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in different scenarios.
